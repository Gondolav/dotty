In this report, Dotty\textquotesingle s dependent types and match types have been proved capable of trading off compile time performance and ease of use for additional type safety. Here, some possible extensions and improvements to the presented regex library are described.

The current work covers a subset of regular expressions; a natural extension would be to support a larger subset, such as +, \^{} (not) or even | (or), although at the moment match and dependent types do not allow it. It would also be useful to have predefined character classes, such as \textbackslash{}d for a digit, and more advanced ones, such as [a-zA-Z]. Quantifiers of the form X\{n\} (X exactly n times) would be also relatively easy to implement. A major addition would be allowing nested capturing groups, but they would be more complicated to provide without significant changes to the algorithm.
