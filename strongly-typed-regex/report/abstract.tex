With the goal of analyzing two new Dotty features, dependent and match types, we present a strongly-typed library for regular expressions. Developed for type-level programming as a way to provide additional type safety, these experimental functionalities are here used to improve the expressiveness of the Scala standard library. With our implementation, we demonstrate that dependent and match types can achieve their purpose, although the user might forego some performance and ease of use.
